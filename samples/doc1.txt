#[of]:About
Code Browser is a folding text editor for Linux and Windows, designed to hierarchically structure any kind of text file and especially source code. 
It makes navigation through source code faster and easier.

Code Browser is especially designed to keep a good overview of the code of large projects, 
but is also useful for a simple css file. Ideal if you are fed up of having to scroll through thousands of lines of code.

See the Introduction to Code Folding page if you want more information on text folding and the way it is implemented in Code Browser.

It supports syntax highlighting for all major languages and custom syntax highlighting can also be added.

Although Code Browser was initially designed to edit programs, it can also be used for different tasks such as plain text 
outlining or helping to understand existing source code. I've added a page with suggestions to take advantage of folding.
